Case Study:
design an automated workflow using scripting,opensource tools, and publicly availiable info to detct and 
automattically remediate (at least creating a pull request) security vulnerabilities found in software dependencies.  
For example, if one were to choose a tool that can scan for dependency vulnerabilities and then automate the output of this tool 
to automatically create a github pull request for the new version of this dependency this would meet the overall criterai. 
However there are opportunities to show creativity.

Assumptions:
the language being tested for dependency issues is Ruby utilizing the Rails platform 
The CI/CD pipeline consists of github, codefresh and amazon eks
while there are commercially availiable products that can accomplish this, these should be used as reference only
scripting can be any language
do not attempt to write a scanner from scratch, this is outside the scope of the challenge. 
the goal here is to show the ability to understand automation of security output.
